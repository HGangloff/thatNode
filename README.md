# thatNode
thatNode is a project that aims to implement algorithms from mathematical morphology for graphs. The current work does not use structuring elements (or structuring graphs), see research papers.

thatNode is based on the research paper : GRAPHS AND MATHEMATICAL MORPHOLOGY by Luc VINCENT (April 1988) and GRAPH MORPHOLOGY IN IMAGE ANALYSIS by Henk HEIJMANS and Luc VINCENT (1992)

Keywords : Mathematical Morphology, Graphs, Graph Morphology, Python, Networkx


Operators implemented so far : erosion, dilatation, opening, closing, skeleton
