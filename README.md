# thatNode
thatNode is a project that aims to implement algorithms from mathematical morphology for graphs. The current work does not use structuring elements (or structuring graphs), see research papers.

thatNode is based on the research paper : GRAPHS AND MATHEMATICAL MORPHOLOGY by Luc VINCENT (April 1988) and GRAPH MORPHOLOGY IN IMAGE ANALYSIS by Henk HEIJMANS and Luc VINCENT (1992)

Morphologic operators implemented so far : erosion, dilatation, opening, closing, skeleton, geodesic reconstruction, external morphologic gradient, internal morphologic gradient, symetrical morphologic gradient, laplacian

Keywords : Mathematical Morphology, Graphs, Graph Morphology, Python, Networkx
